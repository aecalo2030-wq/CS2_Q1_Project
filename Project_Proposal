Project Proposal - First Draft
Project Title
SalesTracker: Daily Sales Calculation

# Problem Statement: 
Small retail shops often calculate their daily sales manually, leading to errors, lost records or
difficulty in tracking trends over time. Without a simple automated system, owners might forger
to record sales data, making it hard to compare current performance with past results.
This project adresses the need for a simple, lightweight, secure and offline capable python tool that
calculates daily sales, stores them in a local database, and allows quick access to previous days
sales records and totals it weekly, monthly and yearly, all only after successful user authentication.

# Project Objectives:

1. Create a Python based program that calculates the total sales for a given day based on the users
inputs.
2. Store each day's sales record in a simple local data base.
3. Require a username and password login before accessing sales data.
4. Enable the user to view previous days sales when the program is run again.
5. Maintain a simple, intuitive interface for quick daily use.
6. Ensure data is stored persistently even after the program is closed.

# Planned Features:
User Login System - requires username and passwod to access the program.
Daily Sales Entry - user inputs product sales or total revenue for the day
Automatic Calculation - the program calculates total sales and saves them automatically.
Previous Sales Retrieval - opetion to view the sales record from yesterday.
Local Database Stortage - uses SQLite for simplicity and portability.
Basic Report - displays total sales and date in a readable format

# Planned inputs and outputs:

Inputs:
Username and password for authentication
Daily sales figures (Can be entered as product prices or the total daily amount)
Date (Optional but it refaults to system date
Outputs:
Login success/failure message
Confirmation of daily sales saved
Display of yesterdays sales amount and date upon request
Notifies the user if no previous sales data exists

Logic Plan:
Start
  Display "Welcome to SalesTracker"
  Ask user: "Enter Username:"
  Ask user: "Enter password:"
  Check if credentials match stored data
  If login fails: 
    Display "Invalid credentials, access denied"
    Exit
  End if

  Ask_User: "Enter today's total sales:"
  Save todays sales with crurent date in the data base

  Ask_User: "Do you want to view yesterdays sales? (Y/N)"
  If yes:
    Retrieve yesterdays sales 
    If record exists
      Display yesterdays sales 
    Else:
      Display "No data found for yesterday"
  End If
  Exit
End
